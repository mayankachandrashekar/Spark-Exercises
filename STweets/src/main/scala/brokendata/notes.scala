  Notes:

  NLP Pre-Processing:
    Stanford NLP seems really slow, will investigate chalk




  TFIDF:
  The TFIDF vectorizor expects the data to be a RDD[Vector], when attempting to fit the idf model where the data was
  RDD[Int, Vector], calling idf.transform(RDD[INT, Vector]._2) would fail. digging around showed that this generally agreed as not good
  with calls for a PR to fix it. A work around in to create 2 copies of the data:
    - 1 data set consisting of LabeledPoint(numericLabel, Vector)
    - another dataset that is just the vectors
    - then zip the 2 together and return a new labeled point.
